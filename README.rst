Gamma Lab
=========

Python toolkit for soundcard gamma spectroscopy.


Introduction
------------

This package is a Python package  for the acquisition and analysis of 
soundcard data, specifically for gamma spectroscopy kits that use a 
soundcard as their ADC interface. In contrast to other software for this, 
it consists of independent building blocks ("services") that can be 
connected to form different analysis pipelines. Examples of this are 
included in the repository in the *examples* directory.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need at least:

- Python 2.7 or 3.6 or later,
- numpy
- pyaudio

and recommended is:

- matplotlib

Installation
------------

Easiest is to use pip::

  pip install GammaLab

Usage
-----

An example application that acquires data and plots a gamma spectrum is 
included, you can get help::

  ./gammalab-histogram.py --help

but this is only a limited preview of the possibilities that the Gamma Lab 
offers. You can compose your own applications, examples of this are in the 
*examples* directory.

More details
------------

The applications consist of components "services" that are connected with 
"wires." For a component to be included it needs to be imported and 
instantiated::

  from gammalab.acquisition import Soundcard
  soundcard=Soundcard()

After instantiating additional components, say::

  from gammalab.backend import SaveRaw
  save=SaveRaw()

they need to be "wired"::

  soundcard.plugs_into(save)

At the moment, components can have one input and one output, but an output can be connected to
multiple components. When all components are wired, you start the pipeline::

  main(timout=100)

The timeout is optional. If ommitted the application will run until <enter> is pressed.

The following services are available::

  from gammalab.acquisition import SoundCard
  from gammalab.acquisition import Noise
  from gammalab.transform import Raw2Float
  from gammalab.transform import DownSampleMaxed
  from gammalab.transform import Identity
  from gammalab.analysis import PulseDetection
  from gammalab.analysis import Histogram
  from gammalab.analysis import Count
  from gammalab.backend import Playback
  from gammalab.backend import Monitor
  from gammalab.backend import SaveRaw

Development
-----------

It is not difficult to program additional services. A service is a class 
with at least the methods: ```start`` ```stop``` and ```close```. A service 
which accepts input should instantiate a "wire" class defining its input and
have connect_input and receive_input methods (normally taken care of by 
deriving from ReceivingService class). If it generates output, the service 
should have an output_protocol method, which checks the input wire format
and propagates any additional information to the wire. It also needs to have 
some methods normally implmented by deriving from the SourceService class
(notably the ```plugs_into``` method). Services start up a seperate thread to 
do their computations. This could also be using some other package's thread
(e.g. for soundcard acquisition pyaudio's callback thread is used).

The simplest example of a service is the following::

  class Identity(ThreadService, SourceService, ReceivingService):
      def __init__(self):
         SourceService.__init__(self)
         ReceivingService.__init__(self)
         ThreadService.__init__(self)
         self.input_wire=RawWire()
         
     def output_protocol(self, wire):
         assert isinstance(wire, RawWire)
         wire.CHANNELS=self.input_wire.CHANNELS
         wire.RATE=self.input_wire.RATE
         wire.FORMAT=self.input_wire.FORMAT

      def process(self, data):
         return data

This service just forwards the input data (a raw byte stream) to its output.
